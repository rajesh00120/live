    <p>You may have heard of Steve Saint, a man in our lifetime who has spent a good portion of his life among indigenous tribes. One of his quotes lives in my heart and inspires me daily. “Your story is the greatest legacy that you will leave to your friends. It’s the longest-lasting legacy you will leave to your heirs.” </p> 
    <p>Stories about heroes and villains have been recorded throughout human history. We have moved from cave drawings and scrolls to digital records. We can trace our family lineage through websites and services. We can gain precious information about genetic diseases and disorders. We can even find long lost loved ones.</p>
    <p>However, we can only read this information. We can’t see it. We can only see what has been documented on paper. We can’t hear the sounds and see the facial gestures that provide the tone and personality of the person - until now.</p>
    <p>We all want to leave a legacy and be known for the rest of time. Rather than only reading information, we can now see people’s personalities come alive through pictures and videos. Legacy is an app that is changing the way we record history. Unlike the way we have previously recorded history, every user can now create their own legacy. It’s not just for the social elite or greatest teammate because everyone deserves to have their life recorded. Imagine this - your granddaughter is sitting in your lap and you are reminiscing about the old days playing ball. Like many who age, the details are fuzzy, so you can only tell your granddaughter so much. You weren’t noted in any hall of fame, but you served an important part in every game. You can go over the games and leave the rest up to their imagination. With Micah, you can show her pictures and videos from the old days. The details are stored in a secure server, so you don’t have to worry about losing the details of these memories as you age.</p>
    <p>Renowned as the “Father of American psychology”, William James was a leading thinker in the late nineteenth century. His deep understanding of philosophy and psychology allowed him to pioneer two movements: pragmatism and functionalism. With his legacy, he left us with this quote to ponder, “The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.”</p>
    <p>Micah creates a 3D timeline with photos and videos. You can go back to the exact date of an event and look at the memories with crystal clear detail. Micah could be considered your personal museum. Rather than historical artifacts, you can reminisce about your greatest accomplishments, achievements, and goals.</p>
    <p>If a parent has passed, you know the pain and emptiness that is left in your heart. Your children will never get to meet their grandfather or grandmother who played important parts in developing new technologies for future generations. This app provides you with a platform where you can show your kids your parents’ contribution to the world they live in now. They may not be there in person, but your children can still know about their grandparents.</p>
    <p>Micah is for everyone’s personal history. We can use this app to honor our fallen heroes and celebrate each generations’ greatest motivators and influencers. We can watch social movements come to life. With better documentation of our collective history, we can leave future generations with the greatest examples of character and faith along with love and passion.</p>
    <p>Benjamin Disraeli served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice in the 1800’s. His legacy still lives on through his creation of the modern Conservative Party. He understood the importance of leaving future generations examples of leadership and character. He once said, “The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.”</p>
    <p>Your life and your contributions to the future generations matter. Leave your stamp on the future with Micah.</p>
